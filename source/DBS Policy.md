# Policy Information
| **Last Updated**   | November 2025 |
|--------------------|---------------|
| **Due for Review** | November 2026 |

Note: This policy was written with guidance from Selby CoderDojo's DBS Policy

# Purpose 
The purpose of this policy statement is to outline the procedures for vetting volunteers.

# Scope

This policy applies to anyone working on behalf of Wwham, including senior managers and the board of trustees, paid staff, volunteers, sessional workers, agency staff and students.

# Recruitment and Vetting Process

Prospective new volunteers will be invited to an in person conversation with the an existing volunteer or trustee and / or a ‘taster’ Code Club (the club) session to ensure they understand how the club operates.

## DBS Checks
- All volunteers will be required to have (or undergo a new) relevant DBS check.
- If a volunteer is already subscribed to the DBS Update Service, and a check shows their certificate is still current, this satisfies the requirements of this policy.
- Wwham will cover the cost of DBS checks where required.
- DBS checks will be renewed (or in the case of the Update Service, re-checked) every three years or sooner if required by safeguarding guidelines.

## Supervision of Volunteers
- At no point will any adult be left alone with a young person.
- All activities & events will take place in group settings with at least two DBS’d adults present.

# Training
- All volunteers will receive safeguarding training as part of their induction.
- All volunteers volunteering at Wwham's Wirral Code Club will be required to complete the e-learning safeguarding module from Raspberry Pi

# Record Keeping
- Records of DBS checks, training, and references will be securely stored and managed in compliance with data protection laws.
- A register of youth participants will be maintained for each session.

# Reporting Concerns
- Any concerns about the conduct of a volunteer, staff member, or other adult must be reported immediately to the Safeguarding Lead.
- Concerns will be handled in line with Wwham’s Safeguarding policy

# Secure Handling of DBS Certificate Information
## General principles
As an organisation using the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checking service to help assess the suitability of applicants for positions of trust, Wwham complies fully with the code of practice regarding the correct handling, use, storage, retention and disposal of certificates and certificate information.  
It also complies fully with its obligations under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Data Protection Act 2018 and other relevant legislation pertaining to the safe handling, use, storage, retention and disposal of certificate information.
## Handling
In accordance with section 124 of the Police Act 1997, certificate information is only passed to those who are authorised to receive it in the course of their duties. We maintain a record of all those to whom certificates, or certificate information has been revealed and it is a criminal offence to pass this information to anyone who is not entitled to receive it.  
In addition, organisations that require retention of certificates in order to demonstrate ‘safer recruitment’ practice for the purpose of safeguarding audits may be legally entitled to retain the certificate. This practice will need to be
compliant with the Data Protection Act, Human Rights Act, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and incorporated within the individual organisation’s policy on the correct handling and safekeeping of DBS certificate information.
## Usage
Certificate information is only used for the specific purpose for which it was requested and for which the applicant’s full consent has been given.
## Retention
Once a recruitment (or other relevant) decision has been made, we do not keep certificate information for any longer than is necessary. This retention will allow for the consideration and resolution of any disputes or complaints or be for the purpose of completing safeguarding audits.
Throughout this time, the usual conditions regarding the safe storage and strictly controlled access will prevail.
## Disposal
Once the retention period has elapsed, we will ensure that any DBS certificate information is immediately destroyed by secure means, for example by shredding, pulping, or burning. While awaiting destruction, certificate information will not be kept in any insecure receptacle (e.g., waste bin or confidential waste sack).  
We will not keep any photocopy or other image of the certificate or any copy or representation of the contents of a certificate. However, notwithstanding the above, we may keep a record of the date of issue of a certificate, the name of the subject, the type of certificate requested, the position for which the certificate was requested, the unique reference number of the certificates and the details of the recruitment decision taken.

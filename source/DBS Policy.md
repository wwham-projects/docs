# Policy Information
| **Last Updated**   | November 2025 |
|--------------------|---------------|
| **Due for Review** | November 2026 |

Note: This policy was written with guidance from Selby CoderDojo's DBS Policy

# Purpose 
The purpose of this policy statement is to outline the procedures for vetting volunteers.

# Scope

This policy applies to anyone working on behalf of Wwham, including senior managers and the board of trustees, paid staff, volunteers, sessional workers, agency staff and students.

# Recruitment and Vetting Process

Prospective new volunteers will be invited to an in person conversation with the an existing volunteer or trustee and / or a ‘taster’ Code Club (the club) session to ensure they understand how the club operates.

## DBS Checks
- All volunteers will be required to have (or undergo a new) relevant DBS check.
- If a volunteer is already subscribed to the DBS Update Service, and a check shows their certificate is still current, this satisfies the requirements of this policy.
- Wwham will cover the cost of DBS checks where required.
- DBS checks will be renewed (or in the case of the Update Service, re-checked) every three years or sooner if required by safeguarding guidelines.

## Supervision of Volunteers
- At no point will any adult be left alone with a young person.
- All activities & events will take place in group settings with at least two DBS’d adults present.

# Training
- All volunteers will receive safeguarding training as part of their induction.
- All volneteers volenteering at Wwham's Wirral Code Club will be required to complete the e-learning safeguarding module from Raspberry Pi

# Record Keeping
- Records of DBS checks, training, and references will be securely stored and managed in compliance with data protection laws.
- A register of youth participants will be maintained for each session.

# Reporting Concerns
- Any concerns about the conduct of a volunteer, staff member, or other adult must be reported immediately to the Safeguarding Lead.
- Concerns will be handled in line with Wwham’s Safeguarding policy

# ‘Foundation’ model constitution
## Date of constitution 
**last amended**: 19/11/2025

# Name
The name of the Charitable Incorporated Organisation (“the CIO”) is
**We will help and make** (WWHAM)

# National location of principal office

The CIO must have a principal office in England or Wales. The principal office of the CIO is in England.

# Objects

The objects of the CIO are:
1) To promote education in technology, computing, and related fields, particularly for young people, by providing access to learning opportunities, resources, and creative events
2) To advance the education of the public in information and communication technology (ICT), including through workshops, classes, events, and projects designed to develop practical skills and understanding of modern technologies.
3) To organize and deliver events, clubs, competitions, and initiatives that bring together young people, families, and the wider community to learn about and engage with technology in a supportive and inclusive environment.
4) To reduce barriers to digital literacy and technology engagement, ensuring that people from all backgrounds, abilities, and communities have the opportunity to learn and participate in coding, technology, and digital innovation.

Nothing in this constitution shall authorise an application of the property of the CIO for the purposes which are not charitable in accordance with section 7 of the Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Act 2005 and section 2 of the Charities Act (Northern Ireland) 2008.

# Powers

The CIO has power to do anything which is calculated to further its objects or is conducive or incidental to doing so. In particular, the CIO has power to:
1) borrow money and to charge the whole or any part of its property as security for the repayment of the money borrowed. The CIO must comply as appropriate with sections 124 and 125 of the Charities Act 2011, if it wishes to mortgage land;
2) buy, take on lease or in exchange, hire or otherwise acquire any property and to maintain and equip it for use;
3) sell, lease or otherwise dispose of all or any part of the property belonging to the CIO. In exercising this power, the CIO must comply as appropriate with sections 117 and 119-123 of the Charities Act 2011;
4) employ and remunerate such staff as are necessary for carrying out the work of the CIO. The CIO may employ or remunerate a charity trustee only to the extent that it is permitted to do so by clause 7 (Benefits and payments to charity trustees and connected persons) and provided it complies with the conditions of that clause;
5) deposit or invest funds, employ a professional fund-manager, and arrange for the investments or other property of the CIO to be held in the name of a nominee, in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as the trustees of a trust are permitted to do by the Trustee Act 2000\.

# Application of income and property
1. The income and property of the CIO must be applied solely towards the promotion of the objects.
   1) A charity trustee is entitled to be reimbursed from the property of the CIO or may pay out of such property reasonable expenses properly incurred by him or her when acting on behalf of the CIO.
   2) A charity trustee may benefit from trustee indemnity insurance cover purchased at the CIO’s expense in accordance with, and subject to the conditions in, section 189 of the Charities Act 2011\.
2. None of the income or property of the CIO may be paid or transferred directly or indirectly by way of dividend, bonus or otherwise by way of profit to any member of the CIO.
3. Nothing in this clause shall prevent a charity trustee or connected person receiving any benefit or payment which is authorised by Clause 7.

# Benefits and payments to charity trustees and connected persons
## General provisions
No charity trustee or connected person may:
   1) buy or receive any goods or services from the CIO on terms preferential to those applicable to members of the public;
   2) sell goods, services, or any interest in land to the CIO;
   3) be employed by, or receive any remuneration from, the CIO;
   4) receive any other financial benefit from the CIO;
unless the payment or benefit is permitted by sub-clause (2) of this clause or authorised by the court or the prior written consent of the Charity Commission (“the Commission”) has been obtained. In this clause, a “financial benefit” means a benefit, direct or indirect, which is either money or has a monetary value.

## Scope and powers permitting trustees’ or connected persons’ benefits

   1) A charity trustee or connected person may receive a benefit from the CIO as a beneficiary of the CIO provided that a majority of the trustees do not benefit in this way.
   2) A charity trustee or connected person may enter into a contract for the supply of services and/or goods to the CIO where that is permitted in accordance with, and subject to the conditions in, sections 185 to 188 of the Charities Act 2011\.
   3) A charity trustee or connected person may receive interest on money lent to the CIO at a reasonable and proper rate which must be not more than the Bank of England bank rate (also known as the base rate).
   4) A charity trustee or connected person may receive rent for premises let by the trustee or connected person to the CIO. The amount of the rent and the other terms of the lease must be reasonable and proper. The charity trustee concerned must withdraw from any meeting at which such a proposal or the rent or other terms of the lease are under discussion.
   5) A charity trustee or connected person may take part in the normal trading and fundraising activities of the CIO on the same terms as members of the public.

## In sub-clause (2) of this clause:

### "the CIO" includes any company in which the CIO:
   1) holds more than 50% of the shares; or
   2) controls more than 50% of the voting rights attached to the shares; or
   3)  has the right to appoint one or more directors to the board of the company;

### "connected person" includes any person within the definition set out in clause 30 (Interpretation).

# Conflicts of interest and conflicts of loyalty

## A charity trustee must:
1) declare the nature and extent of any interest, direct or indirect, which he or she has in a proposed transaction or arrangement with the CIO or in any transaction or arrangement entered into by the CIO which has not previously been declared; and
2) absent himself or herself from any discussions of the charity trustees in which it is possible that a conflict of interest will arise between his or her duty to act solely in the interests of the CIO and any personal interest (including but not limited to any financial interest).

Any charity trustee absenting himself or herself from any discussions in accordance with this clause must not vote or be counted as part of the quorum in any decision of the charity trustees on the matter.

# Liability of members to contribute to the assets of the CIO if it is wound up

If the CIO is wound up, the members of the CIO have no liability to contribute to its assets and no personal responsibility for settling its debts and liabilities.

# Charity trustees

## Functions and duties of charity trustees

The charity trustees shall manage the affairs of the CIO and may for that purpose exercise all the powers of the CIO. It is the duty of each charity trustee:
1) to exercise his or her powers and to perform his or her functions in his or her capacity as a trustee of the CIO in the way he or she decides in good faith would be most likely to further the purposes of the CIO; and
2) to exercise, in the performance of those functions, such care and skill as is reasonable in the circumstances having regard in particular to:
3) any special knowledge or experience that he or she has or holds himself or herself out as having; and,  
4) if he or she acts as a charity trustee of the CIO in the course of a business or profession, to any special knowledge or experience that it is reasonable to expect of a person acting in the course of that kind of business or profession.

Such a resolution shall be effective provided that

1) The charity trustees may delegate any of their powers or functions to a committee or committees, and, if they do, they shall determine the terms and conditions on which the delegation is made. The charity trustees may at any time alter those terms and conditions, or revoke the delegation.
2) This power is in addition to the power of delegation in the General Regulations and any other power of delegation available to the charity trustees, but is subject to the following requirements:
   1) a committee may consist of two or more persons, but at least one member of each committee must be a charity trustee;
   2) the acts and proceedings of any committee must be brought to the attention of the charity trustees as a whole as soon as is reasonably practicable; and

2) Subject to that, the charity trustees shall decide how their meetings are to be called, and what notice is required.

## Chairing of meetings

The charity trustees may appoint one of their number to chair their meetings and may at any time revoke such appointment. If no-one has been so appointed, or if the person appointed is unwilling to preside or is not present within 10 minutes after the time of the meeting, the charity trustees present may appoint one of their number to chair that meeting.

## Procedure at meetings

   1) No decision shall be taken at a meeting unless a quorum is present at the time when the decision is taken. The quorum is two charity trustees, or the number nearest to one third of the total number of charity trustees, whichever is greater, or such larger number as the charity trustees may decide from time to time. A charity trustee shall not be counted in the quorum present when any decision is made about a matter upon which he or she is not entitled to vote.
   2) Questions arising at a meeting shall be decided by a majority of those eligible to vote.

   3) Meetings held by electronic means must comply with rules for meetings, including chairing and the taking of minutes.

# Membership of the CIO

1) The members of the CIO shall be its charity trustees for the time being. The only persons eligible to be members of the CIO are its charity trustees. Membership of the CIO cannot be transferred to anyone else.

# Decisions which must be made by the members of the CIO

   1. Any decision to:
      1) amend the constitution of the CIO;
      2) amalgamate the CIO with, or transfer its undertaking to, one or more other CIOs, in accordance with the Charities Act 2011; or
      3) wind up or dissolve the CIO (including transferring its business to any other charity)  
   
      must be made by a resolution of the members of the CIO (rather than a resolution of the charity trustees).

   2. Decisions of the members may be made either:
      1) by resolution at a general meeting; or
      2) by resolution in writing, in accordance with sub-clause (4) of this clause.

   3. Any decision specified in sub-clause (1) of this clause must be made in accordance with the provisions of clause 28 (amendment of constitution), clause 29 (Voluntary winding up or dissolution), or the provisions of the Charities Act 2011, the General Regulations or the Dissolution Regulations as applicable. Those provisions require the resolution to be agreed by a 75% majority of those members voting at a general meeting, or agreed by all members in writing.

   4. Except where a resolution in writing must be agreed by all the members, such a resolution may be agreed by a simple majority of all the members who are entitled to vote on it. Such a resolution shall be effective provided that:
      1) a copy of the proposed resolution has been sent to all the members eligible to vote; and
      2) the required majority of members has signified its agreement to the resolution in a document or documents which are received at the principal office within the period of 28 days beginning with the circulation date. The document signifying a member’s agreement must be authenticated by their signature, by a statement of their identity accompanying the document, or in such other manner as the CIO has specified.

      The resolution in writing may comprise several copies to which one or more members has signified their agreement. Eligibility to vote on the resolution is limited to members who are members of the CIO on the date when the proposal is first circulated.

# General meetings of members

## Calling of general meetings of members

The charity trustees may designate any of their meetings as a general meeting of the members of the CIO. The purpose of such a meeting is to discharge any business which must by law be discharged by a resolution of the members of the CIO as specified in clause 18 (Decisions which must be made by the members of the CIO).

## Notice of general meetings of members

1) The minimum period of notice required to hold a general meeting of the members of the CIO is 14 days.
2) Except where a specified period of notice is strictly required by another clause in this constitution, by the Charities Act 2011 or by the General Regulations, a general meeting may be called by shorter notice if it is so agreed by a majority of the members of the CIO.
3) Proof that an envelope containing a notice was properly addressed, prepaid and posted; or that an electronic form of notice was properly addressed and sent, shall be conclusive evidence that the notice was given. Notice shall be deemed to be given 48 hours after it was posted or sent.

## Procedure at general meetings of members

   The provisions in clause 16.2-16.4 governing the chairing of meetings, procedure at meetings and participation in meetings by electronic means apply to any general meeting of the members, with all references to trustees to be taken as references to members.

#  Saving provisions

1) Subject to sub-clause (2) of this clause, all decisions of the charity trustees, or of a committee of charity trustees, shall be valid notwithstanding the participation in any vote of a charity trustee:
   * who was disqualified from holding office;
   * who had previously retired or who had been obliged by the constitution to vacate office;
   * who was not entitled to vote on the matter, whether by reason of a conflict of interest or otherwise;
   * for whom there is a technical defect in their appointment as a trustee of which the trustees were unaware at the time;
if, without the vote of that charity trustee and that charity trustee being counted in the quorum, the decision has been made by a majority of the charity trustees at a quorate meeting.

2) Sub-clause (1) of this clause does not permit a charity trustee to keep any benefit that may be conferred upon him or her by a resolution of the charity trustees or of a committee of charity trustees if, but for sub-clause (1), the resolution would have been void, or if the charity trustee has not complied with clause 8 (Conflicts of interest).

# Execution of documents

1) The CIO shall execute documents either by signature or by affixing its seal (if it has one).
2) A document is validly executed by signature if it is signed by at least two of the charity trustees.

# Use of electronic communications

The CIO will comply with the requirements of the Communications Provisions in the General Regulations and in particular:
   1) the requirement to provide within 21 days to any member on request a hard copy of any document or information sent to the member otherwise than in hard copy form;
   2) any requirements to provide information to the Commission in a particular form or manner.

# Keeping of Registers

The CIO must comply with its obligations under the General Regulations in relation to the keeping of, and provision of access to, a (combined) register of its members and charity trustees.

# Minutes
The charity trustees must keep minutes of all:
1) proceedings at general meetings of the CIO;
2) meetings of the charity trustees and committees of charity trustees including:
   * the names of the trustees present at the meeting;
   * the decisions made at the meetings; and
   * where appropriate the reasons for the decisions;
3) decisions made by the charity trustees otherwise than in meetings.

# Accounting records, accounts, annual reports and returns, register maintenance

1) The charity trustees must comply with the requirements of the Charities Act 2011 with regard to the keeping of accounting records, to the preparation and scrutiny of statements of account, and to the preparation of annual reports and returns. The statements of account, reports and returns must be sent to the Charity Commission, regardless of the income of the CIO, within 10 months of the financial year end.
2) The charity trustees must comply with their obligation to inform the Commission within 28 days of any change in the particulars of the CIO entered on the Central Register of Charities.

# Rules

The charity trustees may from time to time make such reasonable and proper rules or byelaws as they may deem necessary or expedient for the proper conduct and management of the CIO, but such rules or bye laws must not be inconsistent with any provision of this constitution. Copies of any such rules or bye laws currently in force must be made available to any member of the CIO on request.

# Disputes

If a dispute arises between members of the CIO about the validity or propriety of anything done by the members under this constitution, and the dispute cannot be resolved by agreement, the parties to the dispute must first try in good faith to settle the dispute by mediation before resorting to litigation.

# Amendment of constitution

As provided by sections 224-227 of the Charities Act 2011:
1) This constitution can only be amended:
   1) by resolution agreed in writing by all members of the CIO; or
   2) by a resolution passed by a 75% majority of those voting at a general meeting of the members of the CIO called in accordance with clause 19 (General meetings of members).
2) Any alteration of the CIO’s objects, of any provision of the CIO’s constitution directing the application of property on its dissolution or any provision of the CIO’s constitution where the alteration would provide authorisation for any benefit to be obtained by charity trustees or members of the CIO or persons connected with them, requires the prior written consent of the Charity Commission.  
3) No amendment that is inconsistent with the provisions of the Charities Act 2011 or the General Regulations shall be valid.
4) A copy of every resolution amending the constitution, together with a copy of the CIO’s constitution as amended must be sent to the Commission by the end of the period of 15 days beginning with the date of passing of the resolution.

   2) by a resolution agreed in writing by all members of the CIO.
2) Subject to the payment of all the CIO’s debts:
   1) Any resolution for the winding up of the CIO, or for the dissolution of the CIO without winding up, may contain a provision directing how any remaining assets of the CIO shall be applied.
   2) If the resolution does not contain such a provision, the charity trustees must decide how any remaining assets of the CIO shall be applied.
   3) In either case the remaining assets must be applied for charitable purposes the same as or similar to those of the CIO.
3)  The CIO must observe the requirements of the Dissolution Regulations in applying to the Commission for the CIO to be removed from the Register of Charities, and in particular:

## General meetings of members

### Proxy voting
1) Any member of the CIO may appoint another person as a proxy to exercise all or any of that member’s rights to attend, speak and vote at a general meeting of the CIO. Proxies must be appointed by a notice in writing (a “proxy notice”) which:
   1) states the name and address of the member appointing the proxy;
   2) identifies the person appointed to be that member’s proxy and the general meeting in relation to which that person is appointed;
   3)  is signed by or on behalf of the member appointing the proxy, or is authenticated in such manner as the CIO may determine; and
   4)  is delivered to the CIO in accordance with the constitution and any instructions contained in the notice of the general meeting to which they relate.
2) The CIO may require proxy notices to be delivered in a particular form, and may specify different forms for different purposes.
3) Proxy notices may (but do not have to) specify how the proxy appointed under them is to vote (or that the proxy is to abstain from voting) on one or more resolutions.
4) Unless a proxy notice indicates otherwise, it must be treated as:
   1) allowing the person appointed under it as a proxy discretion as to how to vote on any ancillary or procedural resolutions put to the meeting; and
   2) appointing that person as a proxy in relation to any adjournment of the general meeting to which it relates as well as the meeting itself.
5) A member who is entitled to attend, speak or vote (either on a show of hands or on a poll) at a general meeting remains so entitled in respect of that meeting or any adjournment of it, even though a valid proxy notice has been delivered to the CIO by or on behalf of that member.
6) An appointment under a proxy notice may be revoked by delivering to the CIO a notice in writing given by or on behalf of the member by whom or on whose behalf the proxy notice was given.
7) A notice revoking a proxy appointment only takes effect if it is delivered before the start of the meeting or adjourned meeting to which it relates.
8) If a proxy notice is not signed or authenticated by the member appointing the proxy, it must be accompanied by written evidence that the person who signed or authenticated it on that member’s behalf had authority to do so.

### Postal Voting

1) The CIO may, if the charity trustees so decide, allow the members to vote by post or electronic mail (“email”) to elect charity trustees or to make a decision on any matter that is being decided at a general meeting of the members.
2) The charity trustees must appoint at least two persons independent of the CIO to serve as scrutineers to supervise the conduct of the postal/email ballot and the counting of votes.
3) If postal and/or email voting is to be allowed on a matter, the CIO must send to members of the CIO not less than 21 days before the deadline for receipt of votes cast in this way:
   1) a notice by email, if the member has agreed to receive notices in this way under clause 22 (Use of electronic communications), including an explanation of the purpose of the vote and the voting procedure to be followed by the member, and a voting form capable of being returned by email or post to the CIO, containing details of the resolution being put to a vote, or of the candidates for election, as applicable;
   2) a notice by post to all other members, including a written explanation of the purpose of the postal vote and the voting procedure to be followed by the member; and a postal voting form containing details of the resolution being put to a vote, or of the candidates for election, as applicable.
4) The voting procedure must require all forms returned by post to be in an envelope with the member’s name and signature, and nothing else, on the outside, inside another envelope addressed to ‘The Scrutineers for WWHAM’, at the CIO’s principal office or such other postal address as is specified in the voting procedure.
5) The voting procedure for votes cast by email must require the member’s name to be at the top of the email, and the email must be authenticated in the manner specified in the voting procedure.
6) Email votes must be returned to an email address used only for this purpose and must be accessed only by a scrutineer.
7) The voting procedure must specify the closing date and time for receipt of votes, and must state that any votes received after the closing date or not complying with the voting procedure will be invalid and not be counted.
8) The scrutineers must make a list of names of members casting valid votes, and a separate list of members casting votes which were invalid. These lists must be provided to a charity trustee or other person overseeing admission to, and voting at, the general meeting. A member who has cast a valid postal or email vote must not vote at the meeting, and must not be counted in the quorum for any part of the meeting on which he, she or it has already cast a valid vote. A member who has cast an invalid vote by post or email is allowed to vote at the meeting and counts towards the quorum.
9) For postal votes, the scrutineers must retain the internal envelopes (with the member’s name and signature). For email votes, the scrutineers must cut off and retain any part of the email that includes the member’s name. In each case, a scrutineer must record on this evidence of the member’s name that the vote has been counted, or if the vote has been declared invalid, the reason for such declaration.
10) Votes cast by post or email must be counted by all the scrutineers before the meeting at which the vote is to be taken. The scrutineers must provide to the person chairing the meeting written confirmation of the number of valid votes received by post and email and the number of votes received which were invalid.
11) The scrutineers must not disclose the result of the postal/email ballot until after votes taken by hand or by poll at the meeting, or by poll after the meeting, have been counted. Only at this point shall the scrutineers declare the result of the valid votes received, and these votes shall be included in the declaration of the result of the vote.
12) Following the final declaration of the result of the vote, the scrutineers must provide to a charity trustee or other authorised person bundles containing the evidence of members submitting valid postal votes; evidence of members submitting valid email votes; evidence of invalid votes; the valid votes; and the invalid votes.
13) Any dispute about the conduct of a postal or email ballot must be referred initially to a panel set up by the charity trustees, to consist of two trustees and two persons independent of the CIO. If the dispute cannot be satisfactorily resolved by the panel, it must be referred to the Electoral Reform Services.

## Use of electronic communications

### To the CIO

Any member or charity trustee of the CIO may communicate electronically with the CIO to an address specified by the CIO for the purpose, so long as the communication is authenticated in a manner which is satisfactory to the CIO.

### By the CIO
1)  Any member or charity trustee of the CIO, by providing the CIO with his or her email address or similar, is taken to have agreed to receive communications from the CIO in electronic form at that address, unless the member has indicated to the CIO his or her unwillingness to receive such communications in that form.
2) The charity trustees may, subject to compliance with any legal requirements, by means of publication on its website:
   1) provide the members with the notice referred to in clause 19(2) (Notice of general meetings);
   2) give charity trustees notice of their meetings in accordance with clause 16(1) (Calling meetings); and
   3) submit any proposal to the members or charity trustees for decision by written resolution or postal vote in accordance with the CIO’s powers under clause 18 (Members’ decisions), 18.4 (Decisions taken by resolution in writing), or 31.2 (Use of electronic communications).

3) The charity trustees must:
   1) take reasonable steps to ensure that members and charity trustees are promptly notified of the publication of any such notice or proposal; 
   2) send any such notice or proposal in hard copy form to any member or charity trustee who has not consented to receive communications in electronic form.
